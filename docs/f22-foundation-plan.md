# BuddyAI F-22 Foundation Plan

This document is the execution system that turns BuddyAI from an MVP into a durable, high-impact product.

## 1) What We Need From Founder/Oversight (You)

To move fast **without drifting from your vision**, we need clear decisions in these areas:

### A. Product Direction (North Star)
- Primary outcome for users in the next 90 days (e.g., reduced pre-event anxiety; improved confidence before classes/interviews).
- Top 1-2 user segments to prioritize first (e.g., first-year college students, job-seeking seniors).
- Non-negotiable product principles (tone, boundaries, clinical safety, faith/spiritual framing if any).

### B. Scope Governance
- A ranked list of features by impact (Must, Should, Could).
- “No-build list” for the current phase so the team avoids side quests.
- Weekly decision cadence: one async update + one 30-min strategy checkpoint.

### C. Risk & Safety Decisions
- Crisis escalation policy by geography and age range.
- Content boundaries (what BuddyAI must not do; referral language standards).
- Data retention policy (how long chat history and scores are stored).

### D. Growth & Distribution
- Priority launch channel (campus orgs, counseling centers, student ambassadors, social video).
- Partnership targets and introductions only you can unlock.
- Story and messaging guardrails to preserve mission authenticity.

## 2) Foundations To Lay Down Immediately

### Foundation 1 — Product Operating System
Create one source of truth in the repo with:
- Mission + target persona + success metrics.
- Current sprint goals and acceptance criteria.
- Decision log for irreversible choices (safety, pricing, architecture).

### Foundation 2 — Measurement and Feedback Loops
Track only the metrics that matter now:
- Assessment completion rate.
- Insight usefulness rating.
- Simulator session completion rate.
- % users returning within 7 days.
- Safety interruption rate and resolution path.

### Foundation 3 — Safety and Trust Framework
- Dedicated safety spec for crisis language, disclaimers, and handoff policy.
- Red-team scenarios (self-harm ideation, panic spirals, harmful dependency prompts).
- Manual review workflow for edge-case conversations.

### Foundation 4 — Architecture for Scale
- Typed contract between frontend and backend endpoints.
- Request tracing + structured logs for prompt/response debugging.
- Feature flags for rapid experiments without risky deploys.
- Session state abstraction so persistent profiles can be added safely.

### Foundation 5 — Team Execution Rhythm
- Weekly sprint with one owner per deliverable.
- Demo day every 7 days with a go/no-go checklist.
- Bug triage SLA (critical in 24h, medium in 72h).

## 3) 30-Day Execution Plan (High Velocity)

### Week 1: Stabilize the Core
- Harden assessment + insight rendering reliability.
- Add persistent profile scaffold (auth optional; anonymous ID acceptable at first).
- Add basic analytics events.

### Week 2: Improve Outcomes
- Ship daily micro-challenge recommendation based on lowest dimension.
- Add post-session reflection and confidence delta capture.
- Build first quality dashboard from real usage.

### Week 3: Increase Stickiness
- Session history and progress timeline.
- Retake flow with trend visualization.
- Lightweight reminders/notifications.

### Week 4: Prepare Expansion
- Pilot package for one campus partner.
- Admin-facing anonymized aggregate insights (v0).
- Pricing experiment and conversion instrumentation.

## 4) Decision Rights Matrix

| Domain | Owner | Input | Decision cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Vision | Founder/Oversight | Product Lead + Users | Weekly |
| Clinical Safety Boundaries | Founder + Safety Lead | Advisor/SME | Immediate when needed |
| Technical Architecture | Tech Lead | Founder for constraints | Weekly |
| Launch Distribution | Founder | Growth + Partnerships | Weekly |
| Content Tone/Brand | Founder + Design | Product + User feedback | Weekly |

## 5) Ready-to-Run Kickoff Checklist

- [ ] Define 90-day north-star metric and 3 supporting KPIs.
- [ ] Select one primary user segment for current sprint.
- [ ] Approve safety policy v1 and escalation scripts.
- [ ] Confirm sprint backlog with Must/Should/Could labels.
- [ ] Assign owners and deadlines for each task.
- [ ] Create weekly demo + strategy review cadence.

## 6) Founder Input Template (Send This Back)

Copy/paste and fill this so implementation can begin immediately:

1. **North-star outcome in 90 days:**
2. **Top user segment for this phase:**
3. **Three non-negotiables for BuddyAI tone/mission:**
4. **Features we must ship in next 30 days:**
5. **Features we should explicitly postpone:**
6. **Safety boundaries that require strict enforcement:**
7. **Primary launch channel for first distribution push:**
8. **Partners/advisors we can activate now:**
9. **How you want weekly updates delivered (format + day/time):**
10. **Definition of success for the next demo:**

If this is completed, the team can move from idea velocity to systemized execution immediately.
